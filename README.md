# India-Census-2011-Python-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository contains my Day 4 Data Analysis Project, where I used Python &amp; Pandas to analyze the India Census 2011 Dataset containing 640 districts and 25+ demographic attributes.

📁 Project Overview

The project involves:

Importing & reading the Census dataset

Cleaning null/missing data

Exploring demographic columns (Population, Male/Female, Literacy, Workers, Religion etc.)

State-wise & district-wise comparative analysis

Applying styling options like hiding indexes using Pandas Styler

data.style.hide(axis="index")
